	<h3>
		Work
	</h3>
	I am a hobbyist songwriter, music producer, programmer, and artist.
	<h3>
		Accomplishments
	</h3>
	I graduated from the University of Maine in 2023 with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.
	<h3>
		Philosophy
	</h3> 
	I'm motivated by a desire for self-improvement in order to become someone capable of making great positive change in the world. I believe that by dedicating myself to my passions, I can gain the knowledge and skill required to <u>create</u> things that are worthwhile, <u>deconstruct</u> things for the purpose of building knowledge, and <u>assist</u> others so that they can do the same.
	<br>
	<br>
	"How does creating art achieve that goal?"
	<br>
	<br>
	I believe that now more than ever, the communication of ideas has a tangible effect on the ways people think and act. Art is the expression of ideas and fiction can communicate real ideas in ways that people can interact with through discussion. By creating worthwhile art, we can inspire discussion, leading to change.
	<br>
	<br>
	Of course, I can't expect all my art to have that kind of influence nor can I expect people to see the merits of my art through that alone. Fortunately, art can inherently add to the world through its impact on the observer. When paired down to its fundamentals, appreciation of art is just the mind comprehending patterns, but those patterns can elecit emotions and coalesce into experiences. Good art can create feelings so complex and so pleasurable that it makes life more enjoyable, and that's an ultimate good.
	<br>
	<br>
	When it comes to how art should be distributed, I consider myself a copyright law abolishionist. I think all creative works should be in the public domain including my own.
	<br>
	<br>
	Aside from my beliefs on the power of art, I try to have a strong set of principles. I fundamnetally believe that all humans deserve equal rights and that any attempts to structure people into a hierarchy should be dismantled. I'm anti-war, anti-capitalism, and an advocate for the rights for those who are socially disadvantaged, including (but not limited to) people of color, disabled people, and the LGBTQ+.
