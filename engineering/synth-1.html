							I’ve been dying to break free<br>

							Don’t think they can make me<br>
							I just need to find my<br>
							They make offers to me<br>
							They know me more than myself<br>
							<br>
							I’d been graced with sickness<br>
							Something messing with my head<br>
							They gave me forgiveness<br>
							Made me lucky I’m not<br>
							Don’t you know it’s wrong to<br>
							Question the authority<br>

							Keeping me captive<br>

							For all that they said was true<br>
							What do they believe they know<br>
							There’s zero comfort in your partner’s eyes<br>

							All hope is gone<br>
							At the break of dawn<br>
							The spirit leaves and the air is mystified<br>

							It’s a point of pride<br>
							Dry-eyed<br>
							Taken for a ride<br>
							When there’s nothing left to hide<br>

							Overture of flight<br>
							Twilight<br>
							Fade into the night<br>
							While there’s nothing left to fight<br>
							<br>
							Taken part of every decision<br>
							And course correcting to break up division<br>
							The storm breaks and I find the eye<br>
							So much further in and I begin inspecting it to check for supply<br>
							There’s little effort in these leaves<br>
							After the petal was received<br>
							<br>
							Mark all the trails within the seals in the gateway<br>
							I’ll let the envelopes in jars wash away<br>
							Powerful forces rip the jars and shred the maps<br>
							But leave the envelopes enclosed and in tact<br>
							Know that the comedy will come to those alive<br>
							All of eternity dies<br>

							While there’s nothing left to fight<br>

							The planets overturns<br>
							Sideways<br>
							Only there to burn<br>
							And there’s nothing there to learn<br>
							<br>
							Finally we’re free<br>
							In no time<br>
							Never to be seen<br>
							And there’s no one to believe

							I’ve fell in love with them<br>
