			In Fall 2022, I took an animation class at my college. These are some of the pieces I made for it.
			<img

			style="width:100%"
			class="center block"
			>
			<h4 style="margin:0.5em">Animated Self Portrait (2022)</h4>
			I created this in a day as a self portrait and my first real attempt at pixel animation.

			<img 
			src="motion/Augment.gif"
			style="width:100%"
			class="center block"
			>
			<h4 style="margin:0.5em">Augment (2022)</h4>
			This is the second piece I made for that animation class. The task was to make a blinking animation, but decided to take it a step further by making it a crying animation.

			<img 
			src="motion/Spider.gif"
			style="width:100%"
			class="center block"
			>
			<h4 style="margin:0.5em">Spider (2022)</h4>
			I had to animate a walk cycle for the class, but I thought it would be fun to have it be a spider, which involves animating more appendages. I originally planned on making it skuttle like a real spider, but made it walk upright in order to better fit the assignment. Instead of rotating the camera, I had the background assets warp, which I thought was more interesting. More animations were made for this class, though I don't think they were good enough to show off.
