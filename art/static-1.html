			This is the layout I use when uploading Sega Genesis music to <a href="https://youtube.com/@Pr0jectFM?si=hetxh9MKy3JqHtcS">my YouTube channel</a>. It depicts analog equipment used for displaying waveforms.

			I created this for a digital art assignment which involved creating a wordless 8-panel comic. It is an adaptation of my own journey in finding a store that sells Kuhli loaches. The creature depicted is an Aquatic Genet, which is a fish-eating mammal.

			This is concept art for the zone in <a href="/romhacks/shima-1">SHIMA</a>. It was also made as a companion to act 2's music. I limited myself to using a more vibrant variation of the color palette used by the NES.

					In the endless catacombs beneath the city, there remain few creatures that aren't outright hostile and only one welcoming of visitors. The navigator is a rare intelligent bat who manages to strike the right balance of curiosity, caution, and evasiveness. Upon finding a creature out of their depths, she will follow them along. She has the catacomb's layout memorized and will often make nonthreatening squeaks in the direction outwards. If the creature refuses to follow, she'll continue to follow behind offering assistance when she can. She may even drop supplies she had found and stored previously, such as light sources and non-perishable foods. She will only make herself visible to the creature when they reach the outside, at which point she is often rewarded with food, water, or even just a warm wing-hug. She is often given supplies she has no use for, but will still store for later for others who need it. Despite the many catacomb-dwellers who could easily kill her given the chance, the greatest threat to her existence is the sun, regardless of the level of filtration. She often gets attached to creatures rivalling her level of intelligence and curiosity, yet they are all surface-dwellers, meaning their interactions with her have to cease as soon as they find their exit. Similar sized bats are occasionally spotted, but they rarely leave their nests due to a natural fear.
